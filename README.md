# Working Draft: KVAL (Key Value Access Language) 

*Grammar* for accessing K,V databases with a bit more ease. First binding intended to be for Golang's BoltDB. 

## Operations:

### Basic inserts and gets

      INS Prime Bucket >> Secondary Bucket >> Tertiary Bucket >>>> Key :: Value
      INS Prime Bucket >> Secondary Bucket >> Tertiary Bucket
      GET Prime Bucket >> Secondary Bucket >> Tertiary Bucket >>>> Key :: Value
      GET Prime Bucket >> Secondary Bucket >> Tertiary Bucket >>>> Key
      GET Prime Bucket >> Secondary Bucket >> Tertiary Bucket
      GET Prime Bucket >> Secondary Bucket >> Tertiary Bucket >>>> {PAT}
      GET Prime Bucket >> Secondary Bucket >> Tertiary Bucket >>>> _ :: Value
      GET Prime Bucket >> Secondary Bucket >> Tertiary Bucket >>>> _ :: {PAT}
      LIS Prime Bucket >> Secondary Bucket >> Tertiary Bucket >>>> Key
      LIS Prime Bucket >> Secondary Bucket >> Tertiary Bucket 
      DEL Prime Bucket >> Secondary Bucket >> Tertiary Bucket
      DEL Prime Bucket >> Secondary Bucket >> Tertiary Bucket >>>> Key
      DEL Prime Bucket >> Secondary Bucket >> Tertiary Bucket >>>> Key :: _
      DEL Prime Bucket >> Secondary Bucket >> Tertiary Bucket >>>> _      
      REN Prime Bucket >> Secondary Bucket >> Tertiary Bucket >>>> Key => Key
      REN Prime Bucket >> Secondary Bucket >> Tertiary Bucket => Third Bucket
      GET _

### Functions

      INS   Insert
      GET   Get values
      LIS   Check existence
      DEL   Delete
      REN   Rename

### Operators

      >>    Bucket:Bucket relationship
      >>>>  Bucket:Key relationship
      ::    Key::Value releationship
      =>    Name assignment
      _     Wildcard

### Capabilities

      {PAT} Given a regex {PAT} for Key XOR Value, find match.

### Restrictions

      Must be >= 1 Buckets for data. 
      {PAT} is not a valid option for an INS query.

### Examples

      Bucket B exists inside Bucket A:                A >> B  
      Check existence of Bucket B inside Bucket A:    LIS A >> B              [Return: True]
      Get key value pairs in B:                       GET A >> B
      Get Root Bucket Contents                        GET _

      Key K1 exists inside Bucket A:                  A >>>> K1
      Check K1 exists inside Bucket A:                LIS A >>>> K1
      Get value for K1:                               GET A >>>> K1
      Add value for K1:                               INS A >>>> K1 :: V1
      Delete K1 value:                                DEL A >>>> K1 :: _
      Delete Values for Keys in Bucket A              DEL A >>>> _
      
      Delete A:                                       DEL A
      Delete B:                                       DEL A >> B
      
      Rename K1:                                      REN A >>>> K1 => K2
      Rename B:                                       REN A >>>> B => C
      
### Recommendations

Idomatic methods for working with KVAL and storing date.  

#### Data: 

Data should be stored as Base64 and for those wanting to retrieve it, it helps to mark it up, like in the following example:

    INS Data Bucket >>>> Data Key :: data:image/png:base64:<base64 encoded data>
    
We can break this down and see the following information in our simple encoding:

    data:                    # let's us know we have a data blob
    image/png:               # mimetype to help users decode the information
    base64:                  # letting us know the data is stored in the db as base64
    <based 64 encoded data>: # the encoded data portion
    
Therefore we can describe the following needed elements to encode data blobs:

    data:<mimetype>:<encoding type>:<encoded data>
    
You can see how this is implemented in our BoltDB reference implementation: https://github.com/kval-access-language/kval-boltdb
